# NFLStats

NFLStats is a powerful tool that allows you to query structured NFL data using natural language. Built with LangChain and powered by OpenAI's LLM, it features a user-friendly interface developed using the Streamlit library.

Iâ€™ve deployed the NFLStats app on the free to use [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) with [2024 play by play data](https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data/releases/tag/pbp). You can try it out here: [NFLStats](https://nflstats-jacky.streamlit.app/)
